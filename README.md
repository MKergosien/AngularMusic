# AngularMusic
This app is very similar to MusicHistory5. Angular music was created from scratch using angular only instead of JS-
it was then was transitioned to using requirejs to remove the many script tags in the HTML. 
This app is functional and simple to read and had made me appreciate angular greatly.
